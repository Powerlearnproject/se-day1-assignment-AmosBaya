#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

 Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems and it 
 involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products such as mobile apps, websites and web applications.
 Software engineering is very important in the technology industry since it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern 
 life, such as communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  1. Development of programming languages - this is the milestone where programming languages such as C and Fortran were developed which enebled computers to be programmed.
  2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline - this took place in the 1960's and it lead to the introduction of standards, and best practices to improve 
     quality, efficiency, and reliability.
  3. The rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s - this revolutionized software engineering by promoting iterative development, collaboration, flexibility, and customer- 
     focused delivery, enabling faster and more adaptive responses to changing requirements.   

     
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

   1.Requirements- Involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   2.Design-Involves creatition of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
   3.Implementation- Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   4.Testing-Consists of conducting various tests to the software to ensure it the meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   5.Deployment- Entails releasing the software to users or customers for use.
   6.Maintenance-Consists of providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

   Waterfall is a linear, sequential methodology with distinct phases e.g., requirements, design, implementation suited for projects with fixed requirements and minimal 
   changes e.g.building a payroll system where processes are well-defined, while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and 
   responding to change ideal for projects with evolving needs such as mobile app development where user feedback shapes the features in it, emphasizing continuous feedback 
   and incremental delivery.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

   Software Developer- Responsible for writing and maintaining code and implementing software solutions.
   Quality Assurance Engineer-  Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
   Project Manager- Oversees the project lifecycle, manages timelines, resources, and team coordination, ensuring the project meets goals, deadlines, and budget constraints.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio and Eclipse. 
  Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g., Git. These tools are very crucial in 
 enhancing productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing 
 capabilities.
 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs
  Strategies to overcome these challenges include effective communication, use of agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and 
  timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

   Unit Testing- Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
   Integration Testing- Consists of testing interactions between different components or subsystems of the software.
   System Testing- This is the testing of the entire software system as a whole.
   Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

   It is the crafting of clear,specific and consize queries or statements given to an AI model for it to provide desired and accurate responses.
   Prompt engineering is crucial because it guides the AI model to understand the specific context, intent, and desired outcome of a query, leading to more accurate, 
 relevant, and efficient responses. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Tell me about software engineering.
Improved Prompt: Tell me what software engineering entails and provide a career path to become a full-stack software engineer.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise, helping the AI model understand the exact request, leading to a more accurate and relevant response.
